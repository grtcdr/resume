Bienvenue!

This repository contains my short and sweet [[https://grtcdr.github.io/data/resume.pdf][résumé]].

* Why LaTeX?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility][Reproducible]] documentation is invaluable.

The benefit that LaTeX brings over any other writing environment is
freedom [1], reproducibility [2] and control [3].

1. LaTeX is plain text. You can edit it locally, offline and use whichever text editor you are comfortable with.
2. LaTeX is used by tens of thousands of researchers to create and share reproducible research.
3. LaTeX, and its accompanying ecosystem of packages is enough to satisfy all of your needs.

* Usage

Turn it into a PDF:

#+begin_src sh
pdflatex -halt-on-error resume.tex
#+end_src

An optional step is to optimize it to achieve a smaller size, install ~ghostscript~ beforehand:

#+begin_src sh
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.5 -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -dPrinted=false -sOutputFile=resume.min.pdf resume.pdf
#+end_src

* Inspirations
