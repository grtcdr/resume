In my spare time, I like to give back to the open source
community. I've also authored my own tools over the years:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  \href{https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina}{\textbf{macchina}}:
  A cross-platform command-line system information fetcher with an emphasis on
  performance, which has recently become a popular contender to many
  well-established tools.

\item
  \href{https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/libmacchina}{\textbf{libmacchina}}:
  A cross-platform library for retrieving system information, from
  uptime and battery information, to the number of packages you have
  installed.

\item
  \href{https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/citron}{\textbf{citron}}:
  A memory-friendly tool delivering system data via on-demand
  notifications, replacing the need for the traditional taskbar.

\item
  \href{https://git.sr.ht/~grtcdr/paspio}{\textbf{paspio}}:
  A small library and command-line tool to measure and
  report password entropy.

\end{itemize}
