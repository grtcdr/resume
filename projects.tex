\section*{Open Source}

  In my spare time, I like to give back to the open source
  community. I've also authored my own tools over the years:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{macchina} — A system information fetcher with an emphasis on performance.
    \item \textbf{libmacchina} — A cross-platform library for retrieving system information.
    \item \textbf{citron}: A tool delivering system data via on-demand notifications.
  \end{itemize}
